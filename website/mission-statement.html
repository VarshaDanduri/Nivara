                            <p>We prioritize the health and safety of both mother and child. Every recommendation is based on peer-reviewed research and pregnancy safety guidelines, avoiding ingredients with high systemic absorption rates.</p>

                            <p>We believe that skincare is a powerful form of self-care and self-expression. During pregnancy, maintaining this connection to oneself becomes even more important as women navigate significant physical and emotional changes.</p>

                            <li><strong>Glycolic acid</strong> has limited absorption and is considered safe for topical use</li>
                            <li><strong>Hydroquinone</strong> has high systemic absorption (35-45%) and should be avoided</li>
