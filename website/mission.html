                        <h3>Self-Love & Connection</h3>
                        <p>We believe skincare is more than just beauty - it's a form of self-love and gratitude towards your body. During pregnancy, when your body is changing rapidly, maintaining this connection becomes even more important.</p>

                        <h3>Safety First</h3>
                        <p>Every product recommendation is based on scientific research and pregnancy safety guidelines. We avoid ingredients with high systemic absorption rates like hydroquinone and controversial compounds like tretinoin.</p>

                        <h3>Holistic Wellness</h3>
                        <p>We understand that pregnancy brings hormonal changes that can affect your skin. Our approach addresses both the physical and emotional aspects of skincare during this transformative time.</p>

                        <div class="story-text">
                            <p>Many women feel deeply connected to their skincare routine as a form of self-care and self-expression. When pregnancy brings about significant hormonal changes, this connection can feel disrupted or complicated by safety concerns.</p>
                            
                            <p>We created Nirvara because we believe that every woman deserves to feel beautiful and connected to herself throughout her pregnancy journey. Our app serves as a trusted companion, providing safe, scientifically-backed skincare guidance that allows you to continue nurturing yourself while protecting your growing baby.</p>
                            
                            <p>Through careful research and expert guidance, we've curated a selection of pregnancy-safe ingredients and products that act locally with minimal systemic absorption, ensuring both your safety and your continued self-care routine.</p>
