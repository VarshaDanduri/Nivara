Skin Confidence: Understanding Pregnancy & Skincare Culture

## Overview

Pregnancy is a transformative journey—physically, emotionally, and socially. Among the many changes women experience, skin transformations are often the most visible and emotionally charged. From hyperpigmentation and acne to dryness and sensitivity, these changes can affect not only physical comfort but also self-image and confidence.

This project aims to build an AR-powered 3D face scanning app that helps women gently monitor and understand their skin during pregnancy. By combining empathetic design, AI-driven blemish detection, and culturally aware feedback, we hope to support women in reclaiming a sense of control and care over their evolving appearance.

## Why Skincare Matters

Skincare is more than surface-level—it’s a ritual of self-care, identity, and emotional grounding. In Maryam Amraei’s theoretical study, *Self-Confidence through Skincare*, participants shared how consistent skincare routines helped them feel “fresh, confident, and ready to face daily life,” enhancing their overall well-being.

However, social media and beauty culture often amplify unrealistic standards, especially during vulnerable periods like pregnancy. This app seeks to counter that pressure by offering personalized, non-judgmental insights that prioritize health, comfort, and emotional support.

## Goals

- Detect and visualize skin changes using AR and AI
- Provide gentle, educational feedback—not medical diagnoses
- Foster self-confidence through personalized care suggestions
- Ensure privacy, consent, and cultural sensitivity throughout

## Inspiration

This project is inspired by the lived experiences of women navigating pregnancy, and by research that highlights the deep connection between skincare and self-confidence. It is built with empathy, science, and a commitment to making technology feel safe and empowering.
